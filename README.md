# EJ-Trading-Platform
Platform for traders, allowing them to analyse past and future data through two popular methods; The Green Line Value and Data Sentiment Analysis (machine learning). The Green Line value looks at a stocks monthly chart and draws a green line when the stock has hit an all-time high and then rested for 3 months. This is seen as a sign for strong buying interest. The Sentiment Analysis uses past data of how a stock has reacted to news related to the stock. It then predicts future movement and predictability of the stock. The program allows the user to select whether it would like the past or future analysis and then takes the user through the necessary inputs to reach an output.
